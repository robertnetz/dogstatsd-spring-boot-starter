dogstatsd-spring-boot-starter
=============================

this project will easily push your actuator metrics to a [dogstatsd-agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/ "Datadogs Website about the Dogstatsd-Agent")
in a [spring-boot environment](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/ "Spring Boot Homepage"). For now, this project will only support Spring-Boot 1.5.x, since
in 2.0.x, spring will introduce [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/ "Micrometer Homepage") as an abstraction for pushing metrics to various vendors.
